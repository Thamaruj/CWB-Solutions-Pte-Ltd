                IoT devices with LPWAN connectivity allow transmitting its readings at a very long range even in harsh urban environment. Integrated radio modules provide superior connectivity characteristics for numerous smart devices. CWBIoT-powered devices for Internet of Things allow rolling out the industrial IoT applications fast and cost-effectively with a high level of autonomy in the wide city areas or across the entire country Smart devices are able to exchange the information and parameters they measure in an automatic manner. Intelligent meters perform monitoring, reading and transmission of data by themselves. <br /><br />No more need in manual reading and site visits to collect data and operate the system Some of our smart devices are already featured with remote control option. The full-duplex connectivity of NB-Fi wireless protocol for example allows to change tariffs of electricity meters remotely, manage the power load limits, close and open control valves of different IoT systems, etc. The long-range Internet of Things technology provides perfect scalability only when the end-device installation is as simple as screwing in the bulb. Utilising the extensive practical and use case experience we aim at developing our devices based on these principles.

                <br /> <br />
                Smart sensors are the integrated devices with IoT radiomodules able to transmit data wirelessly via LPWA network. Such appliances can be used in different IoT applications as part of distributed sensor network. Industrial solutions use a large number of different sensors which required a reliable and robust connectivity.
